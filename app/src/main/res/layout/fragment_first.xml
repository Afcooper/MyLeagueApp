her damage comes from. Her damage really mainly comes from her passive, unless you're going the lethality build. You will want to auto after pretty much every single ability that you cast if possible.
 If you don't auto after your abilities you are going to soon realize you will be doing a lot less damage than you should be. I can't stress how important it is to auto after casting your abilities."
